# Sentiment analysis using deep learning
This repository contains the code for the python implementation of a sentiment analysis classifier. The implementation of Word2vec, a neural word embedding model can be found in the repository. The learned word embeddings were then used for performing sentiment analysis using softmax regression. This model was trained with the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset. This implementation is the solution for the first problem set of "CS224d:Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing", a course taken by graduate students at Stanford University.

The code can be found in the IPython notebook named: "wordvec_sentiment.ipynb"
